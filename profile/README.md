Feel free to add your Go projects or make contributions! This organization is for beginners or more experienced developers, so enjoy! Please do not be afraid to ask questions regarding anything about the projects, contributions, or the language itself in the discussions forum. If you are not comfortable speaking in the forum, please do not be shy to reach me privately! For my first-time contributors, the pinned projects underneath contain a file titled "contributions.md", which contain a step-by-step guide. That said, the other projects are still open for contributions despite not having a guide. Have fun!
