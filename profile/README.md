Feel free to add your Go projects or make contributions! This organization is for beginners or more experienced developers, so enjoy! Please do not be afraid to ask questions regarding anything about the projects, contributions, or the language itself in the discussions forum. By the way, the pinned projects contain guides specifically for first-time contributors. That said, the other projects are still open for contributions despite not having a guide. Have a great time!
