Feel free to add your Go projects or make contributions! This organization is for beginners or more experienced developers, so enjoy! Please do not be afraid to ask questions regarding anything about the projects, contributions, or the language itself in the discussion forum. If you are not comfortable speaking in the forum, please do not be shy to reach me privately! For my first-time contributors, the pinned projects underneath contain a file titled "contributions.md", which contains a step-by-step guide. That said, the other projects are still open for contributions despite not having a guide.

### Joining the Developer Team:
Depending on your contribution and commitment to the organization, you will be invited to the official development team. For further inquires, contact any one of us as we'd all enjoy receiving an extra pair of helping hands!

### Documentation Support:
We would appreciate any help in writing documentation for our applications! If you are fluent in multiple languages, then please contribute by adding documentation as it enables a greater community of developers to access our products. By helping with good documentation, you can improve the production experience and push the open-source community forward!

### Project Ideas:
- Develop a website using the Hugo framework
- Interactive CLI game to kill time
